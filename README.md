# Student Course Registration System


In this script, we implemented a simple registration system by using linked lists. The registration system stores information about students and courses. For each student, the system stores an id, first name, last name, and a list of her/his course enrollments. Each course is represented by its id and title. This system uses a sorted linear doubly linked list with no dummy head node to store the students, and for each student, a sorted linear singly linked list with no dummy head node to store the course enrollments for that student. The students are stored in ascending order of their ids. The courses are stored in ascending order of their ids.
The registration system has the following functionalities:
1. Add a student
2. Delete a student
3. Add a course for a student
4. Withdraw a student from a course
5. Cancel a course
6. Show detailed information about a particular student
7. Show detailed information about a particular course
8. Show all students
